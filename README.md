# RawDog

RawDog is a Swift library that extends RawRepresentable types with arithmetic operations. 
It defines two protocols and an enum to handle arithmetic for types with fallible initializers and infallible initializers.

## Types

- **ArithmeticForFallibleType**: This protocol is for types that have a fallible initializer. The arithmetic operations return optional values to account for the possibility of failure.
- **ArithmeticForInfallibleType**: This protocol is for types that have an infallible initializer. The arithmetic operations always succeed and return non-optional values.
- **BinaryIntegerDivisionStrategy**: This enum defines three strategies for handling division of binary integers: floor, round, and ceiling.

## üß™ Tests

The library is fully tested with 100% code coverage

## üíª Installation

### Swift Package Manager
To add RawDog to your project using Swift Package Manager, add the following dependency in your Package.swift file:

```swift
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/ChristianFox/RawDog.git", from: "1.0.0")
]
```

Don't forget to add RawDog to your target dependencies:

```swift
targets: [
    .target(
        name: "YourTarget",
        dependencies: ["RawDog"]),
]
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Usage

To use RawDog conform your RawRepresentable type to either the `ArithmeticForFallibleType` or `ArithmeticForInfallibleType` protocol, depending on whether your type has a fallible or infallible initializer.

## Example

Here's an example of a struct that represents SISeconds with raw values (Based on Dave DeLong's Time, the inspiration for the library), conforming to the `ArithmeticForInfallibleType` protocol:

```swift
import RawDog

struct SISeconds: RawRepresentable, ArithmeticForInfallibleType {

	let rawValue: Double
	init(rawValue: Double) {
		self.rawValue = rawValue
	}
}
```

Simply by conforming to the `ArithmeticForInfallibleType` protocol
 you can now perform any of the following operations:

```swift

var a = SISeconds(rawValue: 60)
let b = SISeconds(rawValue: 3600)

let c = a + b // 3660
let d = a - b // 60
let e = a * b // 216000
let f = a / b // 60
a += b // 3660
a -= b // 60
a *= b // 216000
a /= b // 60

let aDouble = 2.0
let g = a ~+ aDouble // 62
let h = a ~- aDouble // 60
let i = a ~* aDouble // 120
let j = a ~/ aDouble // 60
a ~+= aDouble // 62
a ~-= aDouble // 60
a ~*= aDouble // 120
a ~/= aDouble // 60

```
